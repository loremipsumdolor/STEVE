The Super Traversing Enigmatic Voice-controlled Engine
======================================================

This is the software portion of S.T.E.V.E.

About:
------
S.T.E.V.E. (the Super Traversing Enigmatic Voice-controlled Engine) was a part-computer, part-robot (mostly part-computer) project
that I worked on while I was in seventh grade. This project is currently dormant, to be potentially revisited someday.

Dependencies:
-------------
* [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org)
* [OpenCV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary)

Instructions:
-------------
1. Edit default values in config.ini.
2. Run index.py.
3. There is none.

You can keep track of S.T.E.V.E.'s progress on GitHub.

**S.T.E.V.E.** was coded by [Jacob Turner], who releases this code under the MIT license.
