The Super Traversing Enigmatic Voice-controlled Engine
======================================================

This is the software portion of S.T.E.V.E.

About:
------
S.T.E.V.E. (the Super Traversing Enigmatic Voice-controlled Engine) is a part-computer, part-robot (mostly part-computer) project
that I've been working on for the past few months. Recently, I've gotten some of the code written, primarily the researching and
updating parts (the former somewhat published, the latter not at all). For the most part, the hardware is non-existant, except for
the basic motor control.

Dependencies:
-------------
* [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org)
* [OpenCV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary)

Instructions:
-------------
1. Edit default values in config.ini.
2. Run index.py.
3. There is none.

You can keep track of S.T.E.V.E.'s progress on its [website], as well as on [GitHub].
